# Munch - Project Pitch


Munch is a recipe search engine that lets you search by ingredients you have at home.

## Background

Many people struggle to come up with ideas for cooking, especially when they have limited time and limited ingredients at home. This can lead to frustration and lack of inspiration. Our recipe search engine web app is targeted at busy users who want to find recipes using the ingredients they have at home. By utilizing Munch to search for recipes, users can easily find inspiration for their next meal and save time in the process.


## MVP

- As a busy individual, I want to be able to search for recipes based on the ingredients I have at home, so I can easily find meal ideas.
- As a frequent user of the app, I want to be able to save my favorite recipes.
